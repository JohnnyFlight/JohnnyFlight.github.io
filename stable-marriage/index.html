    <h1>Premise</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>You are village chief</li>
      <li>Marriage festival soon</li>
      <li>You lose memory and have to speak to people to learn about matches</li>
      <li>Ulitmately you're just solving the stable marriage problem, but with the added step of having to find out the ranking preferences for each person</li>
      <li>Also I want to try to implement a solution that doesn't require two distinct sets of people (ie. men and women)</li>
    </ul>
