    <h1>Can John Have Coffee Yet? (2019 edition because I haven't made this generic yet)</h1>
    <h2 id="answer">Maybe?</h2>

    <h4>Some filler animation will go here.</h4>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Every year (as of 2018) during Lent I abstain from caffeine because I drink too much coffee and my heart can only tolerate so much.</p>
    <p>This little app lets me know if I can drink coffee, and when I can drink it next if I can't.</p>

    <h3>Lent</h3>
    <p>Different religious denominations define Lent differently, but this is the ruleset I use:</p>
    <p>Lent starts on Ash Wednesday (always the day after Pancake Day/Shrove Tuesday)</p>
    <p>Lent ends 40 days after that.</p>
    <p>However, as my birthday is on the 19th April, and Lent this year (2019) ends a couple days before my birthday, I'm contriving a rule to bump it up a few days longer so I can enjoy my first post-Lent coffee on my 26th birthday.</p>
