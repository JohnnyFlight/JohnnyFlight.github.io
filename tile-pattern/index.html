    <h1>Tile Patterns</h1>
    <p>I'm getting my bathroom tiled and saw these cool semi-teardrop shaped tiles that I wanted to use in the shower, so I made this to help me visualise patterns for them.</p>
    <p>The black line marks the corner between the two walls, and the black box is roughly where the shower unit will be. This is pretty close to the exact dimensions of the space I'll be tiling, but if not then I'll just fill in the bottom with a solid colour.</p>
    <p>The left wall is 90cm by 180cm and the right wall is 100cm by 180cm.</p>
