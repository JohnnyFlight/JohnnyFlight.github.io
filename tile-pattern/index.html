    <h1>Tile Patterns</h1>
    <p>I'm getting my bathroom tiled and saw these cool semi-teardrop shaped tiles that I wanted to use in the shower, so I made this to help me visualise patterns for them.</p>
    <p>The black line marks the corner between the two walls, and the black box is roughly where the shower unit will be. The height of the tiles is actually a fair bit taller than this, but I'm going to just have white on the bottom, since I only really care about a pattern for the bit that'll be in my eyeline.</p>
