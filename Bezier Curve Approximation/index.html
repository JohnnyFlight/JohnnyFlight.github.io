    <h1>Bezier Curve Approximation</h1>
    <p>If you had a similar school experience to me, you might have seen something like this in maths class, drawn on a piece of squared paper.</p>
    <p>The more lines you draw, the more the edge resembles a curve rather than straight lines.</p>
    <p>It's not really related to Bezier curves at all, but it's similar in that it builds up a curve with a series of straight lines.</p>
